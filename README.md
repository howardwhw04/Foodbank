# Foocbank Project 
This project consist of HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. Its was completed with my other 5 teammates during my first year, semester 3 in Diploma. This website is design for people to do donation for foodbanks.
Users can choose from a selection of foodbanks to donate. Their details are to be recorded in our database. 

There is two types of users for this website, Admin and normal User. If it is login as Admin, the admin is able to see and alter the data of other users.
